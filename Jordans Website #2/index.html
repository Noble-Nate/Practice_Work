        <h2>Hi! I’m Jordan Fox,</h2>
        <h3>Game Programmer</h3>
        <p>
          I’m currently working towards my Bachelors Degree at the Art Institute of Los Angeles in Santa Monica.
        </p>
        <p>
          I attended Don Bosco Technical Institute in Rosemead, California. In addition to being a College Prep School, they offer Technology programs which students referred to as their “Tech’s”. I have a passion for gaming, so the Tech I chose and was accepted into was Computer Science. In my Senior Year, I was accepted into the Game Programming Tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          In High School, I began learning about programming and became proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++, and C.
        </p>
        <p>
          At The Art Institute, I continued studying C++. I also learned Python, Unreal Blue Prints and C Sharp. I worked alone and with others as a team to develop games.
        </p>
